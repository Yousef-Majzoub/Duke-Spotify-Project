# Duke-Spotify-Project
A Shiny application that benchmarks all music artists that visited Duke University on the last day of classes. 

Data on song features and lyrics was obtained through the Spotify API and web scraping, respectively.   

More specifically, the shiny app benchmarks a selected music artist against other music artists of the same year and against the entire historical record of music artists that visited Duke on the last day of classes. All artists are compared against one another using the top 5 songs of each artist based on the criterion of popularity in Spotify. With respect to the benchmarking exercise, we based our analysis on the following song features: (1) Danceability, (2) Energy, (3) Speechiness, (4) Acousticness, (5) Valence, and (6) Lyric Uniqueness.  This was a team project for a statistical programming course at Duke University.

Run the Rmd File and enjoy the dynamic document that allows you to select an artist that visited Duke and click "Go" to view the benchmark analysis via a radar chart.
